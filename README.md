#### A Note About Day 12
I found this cool paper about the number of Nonogram solutions per line: 
[Nonograms: Combinatorial questions and algorithms][paper] by Barend et al.
I also needed a small python project for a scientific computing course 
that I am taking. So I implemented this in python. Runtime according to the paper 
is $O(nk)$ where $n$ is the length of the line and $k$ is the number of hints 
for the line.
